Description: XPath
        =====
        
        XPath is a Python DSL around a subset of XPath 1.0. Its primary purpose is to
        facilitate writing complex XPath queries from Python code.

        Generating expressions
        ----------------------
        
        To create expressions, use the generators in |xpath.dsl|_::
        
            from xpath import dsl as x
            from xpath.renderer import to_xpath
        
            expression = x.descendant("ul")[x.attr("id") == "foo"]
            xpath = to_xpath(expression)
        
        .. |xpath.dsl| replace:: ``xpath.dsl``
        .. _xpath.dsl: https://github.com/elliterate/xpath.py/blob/master/xpath/dsl.py
        
        HTML
        ----
        
        XPath comes with a set of premade XPaths for use with HTML documents.
        
        You can generate these like this::
        
            from xpath.html import button
            from xpath.renderer import to_xpath
        
            to_xpath(button("Save"), exact=True)
        
        See |xpath.html|_ for all available matchers.
        
        .. |xpath.html| replace:: ``xpath.html``
        .. _xpath.html: https://github.com/elliterate/xpath.py/blob/master/xpath/html.py
