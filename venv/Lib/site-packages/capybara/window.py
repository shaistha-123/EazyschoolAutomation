    The Window class represents a browser window.

    You can get an instance of the class by calling either of:

    * :attr:`windows`
    * :attr:`current_window`
    * :meth:`window_opened_by`
    * :meth:`switch_to_window`

    Note that some drivers (e.g. Selenium) support getting size of/resizing/closing only current
    window. So if you invoke such method for:

    * window that is current, Capybara will make 2 Selenium method invocations (get handle of
      current window + get size/resize/close).
    * window that is not current, Capybara will make 4 Selenium method invocations (get handle of
      current window + switch to given handle + get size/resize/close + switch to original handle)
